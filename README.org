* What it does

  This is a short script that can be called manually (or using cron)
  to check if several web pages got updated.  If so, it will send an
  email to a predefined list of people.

  The program can be controlled using the command line (e.g. one can
  add/remove email addresses and urls).

  It stores information in a config file in the users config
  directory and also uses the local cache dir to store webpage
  information.

  For the web pages, scripts and comments are ignored and only the
  body of the page is saved and compared to the new version.
